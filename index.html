    <!-- <p>
      Before the Navy, my love for technology started with my job at an Apple retail store. I started as a sales specialist and worked my way up to Genius (Customer facing technical support). When I joined the navy I had hoped to get into something just as technical like an IT specialist. Unfortunetly, the options available didnt match my wishes. So I went into construction instead. After two years of that I had the opportunity to become one of the first 26 female enlisted sailor on board submarines. I was chosen months later as part of the inaugural group of women. I then because a Fire Control Technician where one of my many jobs was a system administor for classified networks onboard. Since I recently seperated from the Navy I was lucky enough to be given an opportunity to work for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). -->
