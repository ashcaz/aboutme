      HI! My name is Ashley Casimir. I'm originally from the great state of the New Jersey where we are fiercely passionate bout good pizza and mom and pop bagel shops.

      After graduating high school I got my Bachelors degree in Biology from Kean University. I through one year of my maters program in public administration before I decided I would rather join the navy. The rest of my education and traning after that point have been courtesy of the US Navy.

      Before the Navy, my love for technology started with my job at an Apple retail store. I started as a sales specialist and worked my way up to Genius (Customer facing technical support). When I joined the navy I had hoped to get into something just as technical like an IT specialist. Unfortunetly, the options available didnt match my wishes. So I went into construction instead. After two years of that I had the opportunity to become one of the first 26 female enlisted sailor on board submarines. I was chosen months later as part of the inaugural group of women. I then because a Fire Control Technician where one of my many jobs was a system administor for classified networks onboard. Since I recently seperated from the Navy I was lucky enough to be given an opportunity to work for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).

      I recently completed my goal of working for a tech company in a development role. However, I'm still far behind where I want to be. So my #1 goal right now is to gradute Code Fellows!
